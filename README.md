Arduino serial comunication library
==================================

arduino_serial_comunication is a library that easly alow you to
comunicate with an Arduino device in your C++ program trough the Srial port.

WARNING:
This is a small project made by me, still contains many bugs to fix (especially for the method of reading from Arduino).
Please be patient, I will try to improve as much as possible.

If you find any bug please submit an [issue](https://github.com/JacopoBonta/arduino_serial_comunication/issues/new).
